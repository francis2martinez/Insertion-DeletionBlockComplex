# Python - Sage implementation of Insertion Deletion Block Complexes
This project includes an implementation in SAGE for the single symbol Insertion/Deletion Block Complexes, as well as its application to computing distance between the results of the experiments on Double Strand Breaks experiments by Storici's lab in Georgia Tech, and a comparisson with random sets of words.
