# Finding Minimal 2 Cycles
The accompanying jupyter notebook contains the computations required to prove that any set of words whose insertion chain complex has nontrivial 2-homology must contain at least 8 words. This code discards all smaller complexes by creating all possible 2-dimensional skeletons of complexes where 2-dimensional cells are squares and 1-dimensional cells are edges, and where the boundary operator functions as defined in our paper. Then, using results from the paper, mainly Lemmas A.7 and A.8, we algorithmically and with human analysis for the last few cases, we discard each 2-skeleton, thus proving Theorem 5.7. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We generate all possible 1-skeletons (graphs) with $n=5,6,7$ vertices using the function\\ \texttt{generate\_1\_skeletons(n)}. 
    \item We generate all possible 2-skeletons with the given list of possible 1-skeletons (\texttt{Possible\_Graphs}) that have nontrivial second homology, and that don't contain any of the forbidden patterns from Lemma \ref{lemma:forbidden_patterns}, using the function \texttt{generate\_2\_skeletons(Possible\_Graphs, forbidden\_patterns)}. This function only returns the corresponding sub-complexes with non-zero second homology, as pairs of the form \texttt{(Graph, squares)}, where \texttt{Graph} is the 1-skeleton, and \texttt{squares} is the list of 2-faces. 
    \item For the 2-complexes that still remain after the previous two steps, we count how many different symbols must be inserted in the squares using the function \texttt{count\_inserted\_symbols(G,squares)} and discard those that require only one single symbol inserted, since the desired complex cannot be obtained in this way. To see this, note first that the link of the longest word (and in fact, of any word) needs to be a cycle. Such cycle can only be of sizes 4 or 6, since the 1-skeleton is bipartite and $n\leq 7$. If it was of size 4, it would need to be as described in Theorem \ref{thm:classification_cycles_1dim}, but none of those cycles can be obtained with $a=b$. If it was instead of size 6, it would mean the longest word has 3 incident edges, meaning it gets an insertion of a symbol $a$ at three designated positions. It is straightforward to see then that, up to common affixes, the vertices would be of the form $\{axaya, axay,axya,xaya,axy,xay,xya\}$, for some words $x,y\in\Sigma^*$ with $x,y\not\in \{a\}^*$. But this is also a contradiction, since the second homology of the corresponding Insertion Complex is zero. 
    \item Finally, 5 possible 2-skeletons survive, but applying Lemma \ref{lemma:squares_sharing_edges} to the pairs of squares sharing 2 edges, ultimately shows that these are either impossible or that they have vanishing 2-homology. 
\end{enumerate}
